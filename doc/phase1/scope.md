# Scope

Our learning goals are to design and implement a system that stores patient data, with good design practices and user experience in mind. In doing this project, we hope to learn and/or gain more experience in the technologies included in our tech stack, namely React and Redux on the front-end and MongoDB, Express, and TypeScript on the back-end. Since we have team members interested in both ends, our application will have elements in both, with team members focusing on their area of interest. An important part of the project that our team also aims to get more familiar with is the practice of test driven development, in compliance with good software design principles.

With these goals in mind, we plan to cover the following use cases:
1. Creating new forms
2. Updating existing forms
3. Filling out forms with patient data
4. Saving filled out forms
5. Rendering filled-out forms in a user-friendly, easy to read formatâ€”for example a physician sending a copy of the form to a specialist
6. Versioning history of filled forms

The following use cases may also be implemented if time permits:
1. Searching for and retrieving filled forms by patient name
2. Searching for new forms by procedure ID  

Since these use-cases may be considered as accessories given our goal to learn React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, and TypeScript, and the application is functional without them, they may be omitted if constrained by time.

Out-of-scope for the project will be authentication and encryption.
