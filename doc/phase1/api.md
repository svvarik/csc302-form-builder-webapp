The link to the swagger file: 

https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/bluegreentea/SDCFormEMR-System/1.0.0

We currently have two sets of endpoints. One set is for working with form configurations. These are the form templates that are created by data administrators. A second set of endpoints is for working with specific form responses. These would be the forms that clinicians create, edit, and view.

Additionally, if the link is for some reason not working, the .yaml file describing the endpoints can be found at ./server/openapi.yaml in the repository.
