## **How team ITN is organized**:

### **When and where do we meet?** 
Typically, our team will meet on saturdays at 1PM on discord. During each meeting, meeting notes will be taken on hackmd.io and posted in the `#meeting-notes` channel. The TODO items that come up during the meeting will then be put into a GitHub issues kanban board for teammates to pick up.

### **How do we share our documents?**
We utilize a variety of technologies ot share our documents. As mentioned earlier, meeting notes are made on hackmd.io and shared with the team, while other miscellaneous notes and ideas are hosted on google docs or put directly into the discord server (this mainly pertains to PDF files). 

### **What agile approach will we be using?**
We have decided to adopt a Kanban approach to development and we use GitHub Projects to keep us organized.

### **How are tasks divided? What are the roles in this team?**
We divided tasks based on whether they are backend or frontend. On the frontend, they are responsible for the web client. Then on the backend, they are responsible for endpoints and API. On the frontend, we have Aaron, Stephanie, Sai and Michelle. On the backend, we have Nav, Kieran and Julia. The most experienced with Cypress is Kieran. As such, he is our TDD expert. The people managing our CI will be Kieran and Stephanie. 

### **How will the team communicate with each other?**
Discord will be the primary way the team communicates with one another. Finally, progress is tracked using milestones in GitHub Projects.
